## How to Redirect to WhatsApp

To enable the redirection to WhatsApp, follow these steps:

1. Locate the HTML file where the redirection functionality needs to be implemented.
2. Use the following HTML code to include a link or button that redirects to WhatsApp:
   ```html
   <a href="https://wa.me/XXXXXXXXXX" target="_blank">
       <img src="tech_icon.png" alt="WhatsApp Icon" width="50" height="50">
   </a>
 Replace `XXXXXXXXXX` with the desired WhatsApp phone number.

3. Ensure the `tech_icon.png` file exists in the directory and update the `img` tag with the correct path and filename of the tech icon.
